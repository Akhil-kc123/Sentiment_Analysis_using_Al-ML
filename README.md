# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to analyze Twitter data, aiming to classify tweets into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. With an accuracy of 82%, this model offers insights into public sentiment and the emotional tone across various topics discussed on Twitter.

## Objectives

- Collect and preprocess Twitter data for sentiment analysis.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.
- Implement NLP techniques for data cleaning and preparation.
- Feature extraction with TF-IDF Vectorization.
- Build and evaluate a sentiment analysis model.
- Classify tweets by sentiment.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

Tweets were collected using Twitter's API, focusing on parameters such as tweet text, creation date, likes, and retweet count.

### Data Preprocessing

Text data was cleaned and normalized, including lowercasing, removing URLs, emojis, and special characters.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We explored data characteristics through visualization techniques, analyzing sentiment distribution, tweet lengths, and common terms.

### Feature Extraction

TF-IDF Vectorization was used to transform tweets into a numerical format, highlighting the importance of specific words.

### Model Building and Evaluation

A Logistic Regression model was employed for its efficiency and simplicity. The model's performance was primarily evaluated based on accuracy.

## Results

The sentiment analysis model achieved:

- **Accuracy:** 82%
- **Sentiment Distribution:**
  - Positive Tweets: 39.2%
  - Neutral Tweets: 35.7%
  - Negative Tweets: 25.0%

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates the potential of using machine learning and NLP to extract meaningful insights from Twitter data, suitable for brand monitoring, market research, and analyzing public opinion.

## Future Work

- Explore advanced models like LSTM or BERT.
- Include additional data features such as hashtags and emojis.
- Implement real-time sentiment analysis.
